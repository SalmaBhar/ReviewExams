### 2 Roles needed?
15 shop assistant roles <br>
3 administration roles <br>

### Why produce more than 1 prototype?
because with the prototype you can test that you are fulfilling the client's requirements.

### Pseudo-code
function CountAs():
  count=0
  while col.has_next():
    item=col.has_next():
    if item[0]=="A" or item[0]=="a":
      count+=1
  return (count)
