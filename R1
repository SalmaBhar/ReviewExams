### Ethernet vs Wireless (Reliability in Transmission)
Ethernet is more effective in terms of reliability of transmission because its connection by cable is more secure and does not reduce the bandwidth such as in the wireless connections. Moreover, it is more secure and immune to cyber attacks since attackers cannot connect to the internet unless they are physically connected by a cable which is very unlikely.

### Code
```py
def twosum(x, y):
  sum=0
  if x!=y:
    sum=2*(x+y)
  else:
    sum=x+y
  return (sum)

#testing
print(twosum(2, 2))
print(twosum(9, 167))
print(twosum(7, 2))
print(twosum(10, 10))
print(twosum(0, 0))
``` <br>
